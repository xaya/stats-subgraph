# Subgraph for Xaya Statistics

This repository contains a [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) subgraph
that processes `Registration` and `Move` events of the
[`XayaAccounts`](https://github.com/xaya/polygon-contract/) smart contract
on an EVM chain.

It collects basic usage statistics, such as name registrations, moves sent
(in general), moves sent for individual games and WCHI payments made.
